### Introduction
New technologies like Machine learning and Big data analytics have been proven to provide promising solutions to biomedical communities, healthcare problems, and patient care. They also help in early prediction of disease by accurate interpretation of medical data. At an initial stage the prediction of heart disease can save human lives.

### Dataset : <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci">Heart-disease-prediction dataset</a>

### Dataset Description 
There are 15 columns in the dataset, however the first column name is not a good parameter as far as machine learning is considered so, there are effectively 14 columns.

1.	<b>Age</b> : displays the age of the individual.
2.	<b>Sex</b> : displays the gender of the individual using the following   format : 1 = male
          0 = female.
3.	<b>Chest-pain type </b>: displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format :
           1 = typical angina
           2 = atypical angina
           3 = non - anginal pain
           4 = asymptotic
4.	<b>Resting Blood Pressure </b>: displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit)
5.	<b>Serum Cholestrol</b> : displays the serum cholestrol in mg/dl (unit)
6.	<b>Fasting Blood Sugar</b> : compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. 
   If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1  (true)
                                else : 0   (false)
7.	<b>Resting ECG</b> : 
              0 = normal
              1 = having ST-T wave abnormality
              2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
8.	<b>Max heart rate achieved</b> : displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.
9.	<b>Exercise induced angina </b>: 
              1 = yes
              0 = no
10.<b>	ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest </b>: displays the value which is integer or float.
11.<b>	Peak exercise ST segment </b>: 
              1 = upsloping
              2 = flat
              3 = downsloping
12.	<b>Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy </b>: displays the value as integer or float.
13.	<b>Thal </b>: displays the thalassemia : 
              3 = normal
              6 = fixed defect
              7 = reversable defect
14.	<b>Diagnosis of heart disease </b>: Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not : 
              0 = absence
              1,2,3,4 = present.
